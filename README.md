# About
Gamesapp provides user an option to either play hangman or handcricket 
## Hangman
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
## Handcricket
Hand cricket is played through gestures (called 'throws') similar to rock paper scissors. The total number of fingers extended equates to the equivalent number, with a thumb counting as 6. Throws are made simultaneously by both players, one designated as the batter and the other as the bowler. Runs scored according to the batter's throws until the bowler throws the same, in which case the batter is "out". It is played by school children in India,[18] Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
 # HOW IS IT PLAYED?
## hangman
The system asks the users to select any one of the game 
If the user selects Hangman:
1. system asks for the number of players
2. system also asks for the users name
3. system asks the number of rounds they are willing to play
4. system asks the non player member to give an word to guess
5. point 4 keeps on repeating for the other user as well and also until the number of rounds is completed

## handcricket

1. system asks for the number of over and also the number of player in your team
2. system asks if the user is willing to ball or bat
3. If you choose to bat
3. system asks us to select a number between 1 to 6 and if the selected number matches with the number that is randomly generated then you would be declared as out and if not the number you chose will be added to your score
5. If you choose to ball the procedure will be similar to that of point 4 and if the number that is chosen by you doesnt match with that of a computer then its run will increase

 ## Chalenges Faced and how we overcame it
 1. Being from a electrical background lot of things were new and also had some difficulties to cope up at the begining but practising a bit more kind of helped me to over come the fear
2. Had bit of issue while trying to code the game but there were lot of resources which helped me a lot.
